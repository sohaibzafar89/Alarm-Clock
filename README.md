## Project Description

This console-based alarm clock application is developed in Java and allows users to:

- View current time
- Set an alarm through console input
- Play an MP3 file as an alarm ringtone

The program uses Java's core libraries for time handling and threads, and **JLayer (javazoom)** library to play MP3 audio files.

### Motivation

The project was built to:

- Practice Java object-oriented programming
- Learn how to use threads and timers
- Integrate third-party libraries for MP3 playback
